 Skylendar is a powerfull, portable (Linux/Windows) and modern design astrology software.
 Skylendar is free and released under the GPL license.

The current features of skylendar are the following ones:

* Modern design and interface, 100% internationalizable.
* Portable code.
* Data and Restrictions sets are stored, modified and retrieved
  to/from a SQL database (Actually PostgreSQL 9.3 or more).
* Displays a detailed standard wheel chart with 1 or 2 data columns aside and
	an aspects table.
* Displays a Text List chart, with distance and speed for all the bodies.
* Text List charts can include a Midpoints list of the given data sets + a list of
	aspects of those midpoints with the person's planets.
* Displays an aspects list beneath the standard wheel, sorted by influence or not.
* Local Horizon Chart.
* Ephemeris tables at 0h.
* List of all the objects and aspects with corresponding glyphs.
* Syklendar can store in the DB the values and aspects of a subchart with the
  Extract & Save feature.
* Skylendar can scan along a time span for exact aspects occuring between moving and
	static (natal) rings, or between two moving rings (Dual chart), with respect to the
	chart subtype.
* Active lines. When you click on a chart line beginning with a 'X',
	the corresponding Dataset is created.

You need to upgrade your database too if you upgrade from skylendar 4.0.4nn. Run skydmin and press 'Install/Upgrade'.
 
In order to get some help and description of skylendar, press Ctrl+H keys.

Skylendar uses the Swiss Ephemeris as the astrological calculation
library. Although released under the GPL license, This library is
*** NOT FREE *** for commercial use, i.e. closed sources.
Read its included license file for more info.

Before compiling, you need the following items:

* Qt5 development packages. On windows, qt5 must be compiled with dbus support.
* gcc, g++ (mingw on windows)
* cmake
* PostgreSQL 9.3 (or more) client and server.
* plpgsql language.
* PostgreSQL driver for Qt5.

WARNING: avoid Qt 5.12.0 because there is a glitch in the drag and drop system, and Skylendar is unusable without it.

If you intend to import or export other format than skif you should
 also install the following packages:

* Standard perl environment (ActivePerl on Windows, see http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl).
* perl-XML-DOM.
* perl-DBD-Pg or DBD-PgPP.

tips: the two last packages may have other names in your distribution.
On windows, only PgPP is currently supported. You can download your
packages with the ppm command on windows.

Compiling:

First, unpack the sources with:

tar xJf skylendar-xxx.tar.xz 

in e.g. /usr/local/src/

Then, create a temporary  directory and go to it:

makedir /var/tmp/obj
cd /var/tmp/obj

and run the next command:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_Type=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=xxx yyy

where xxx is the directory where the standard apps are
installed. Usually /usr
and yyy is the skylendar's source directory, e.g. /usr/local/src/skylendar

then compile the application:

make

and install it as ROOT (with su or sudo -s)

make intall


Before running skylendar, check if there is an installed and running
PostgreSQL server. Also, a dbus daemon must be running.
Then, execute skydmin as ROOT (or Administrator on Windows).
If the database has not been installed yet, press the Install/Update button,
and check if there are possible errors.

If everything ok, log in to the databse, then go to the 'Accesses' tab. You'll
see a list of available users and its current database accesses (true/false).
Double click on the corresponding access for changing its value.
Then press OK below. Then, you may attribute a password to the
authorized users (not mandatory).
You MUST obviously grant an access to your own login user before using skylendar.

Don't forget to install the skylendar.pfb file font, or skylendar.ttf for Windows

HINT: If your latitude or longitude numbers are diplayed without
	fractional part, i.e. 12 instead of 12.2, then set the LC_NUMERIC
global variable to "en_US". Example:

export LC_NUMERIC=en_US
